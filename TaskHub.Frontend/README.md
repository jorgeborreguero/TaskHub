# TaskHub Frontend

This is the frontend for my TaskHub project, built with React, TypeScript, HeroUI, and Tailwind CSS. I created this interface to provide a modern, responsive experience for managing tasks, tracking time, and collaborating with teams.

## Features

- Weekly calendar view for tasks
- Create, assign, and update tasks
- Track time spent on each task
- Professional UI with HeroUI and Tailwind CSS

3. Build for production:
